# chrome-extension-server-log

[中文文档](https://github.com/eshengsky/ServerLog/blob/master/chrome-extension-server-log/README_zh.md)

Chrome browser extension, used to view server side logs in dev tools (F12).

Functional features:

* Good log viewing experience.
* Only the logs associated with you will be displayed, and the logs generated by others will not be exported to your dev tools.

This extension is part of [ServerLog](https://github.com/eshengsky/ServerLog), but it's not just for ServerLog. After understaing the [Basic principles](#basic-principles), you can try to create your own log library or modify the existing library to adapt to this extension.

## Preview

## Install

[Install from Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/serverlog/ghmhlknahaejhdlobgpaoocmjlhgmcci)

If you can't access the Chrome Web Store, you can download and install it as follows:

1. Download and decompress from [Release](https://github.com/eshengsky/ServerLog/releases) page.
2. Press [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) in Chrome browser address bar to go to the extension page, and check "Developer mode".
3. Drag the downloaded `chrome-extension-server-log` folder onto the page and click the "Add Extension Program" button.
4. Press F12 to open the dev tools, click `ServerLog` tab, the server side logs will be displayed here.

## What is secret key

For security reasons, the secret key set in the extension will do a comparison with the key on the server side, and the log will be output to the extension only if it is exactly the same.

The default server side key is `yourownsecretkey`.

## Basic principles

1. After the extension is installed, the extension automatically adds the request header `X-Request-Server-Log`, its value is the secret key configured by the user in the extension.
2. The server determines whether it is a legitimate user based on the value of the above request header;
3. In the case of a legitimate user, the server inserts the logs into the response header `X-Server-Log-Data` in accordance with [Conventions](#conventions).
4. The extension listens for network requests received in Network, parses the values of `X-Server-Log-Data`, and outputs the obtained log information to the `ServerLog` Panel of the dev tools.

## Conventions

The server side can use any language or technology and simply follow the following conventions:

1. The log collection must be an array, the array element is an object, each object represents a log, and the object can contain `time`, `type`, `message` the 3 required properties, and `category` an optional property, representing the recording times, log levels (info, warn, error), log content, log type, where `message` must be an array type.

    Example:
    ```js
    [{
        "time": "2017-07-01 09:30:00.200",
        "type": "info",
        "message": ["hello", "world"]
    }, {
        "time": "2017-07-01 09:30:01.300",
        "type": "error",
        "category": "home",
        "message": ["error occurs！"]
    }]
    ```

2. Arrays need to be converted to string types and compressed using the [lz-string](http://pieroxy.net/blog/pages/lz-string/index.html) library to reduce volume.

    Example (JavaScript):
    ```js
    const result = lzstring.compressToEncodedURIComponent(JSON.stringify(logArr));
    ```

3. The above results need to be placed in the response header `X-Server-Log-Data`.
